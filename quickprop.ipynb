    "# Quickprop, an Alternative to Back-Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scott Fahlman's idea to speed up gradient descent\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the slowly converging nature of the vanilla back-propagation algorithms of the 80's/90's, Scott Fahlman invented a learning algorithm dubbed Quickprop [1] that is roughly leaning on [Newton's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method).\n",
    "His simple idea outperformed back-propagation (with various adjustments) on problem domains like the 'N-M-N Encoder' task - i.e. training an de/encoder network with N inputs, M hidden units and N outputs.  \n",
    "One of the problems that Quickprop specifically tackles is the issue of finding a domain-specific optimal learning rate, or rather: an algorithm that adjusts it appropriately dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "In in this article, we'll look at the simple mathematical idea behind Quickprop.\n",
    "We'll implement the basic algorithm and some improvements that Fahlman suggests - all in Python and PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "A rough implementation of the algorithm and some background can already be found in [this useful blog post](https://www.bonaccorso.eu/2017/09/15/quickprop-an-almost-forgotten-neural-training-algorithm/) by Giuseppe Bonaccorso. We are going to expand on that - both on the theory and code side - but if in doubt, have a look at how Giuseppe explains it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "_The motivation to look into Quickprop came from writing [my last article](https://towardsdatascience.com/cascade-correlation-a-forgotten-learning-architecture-a2354a0bec92) on the \"Cascade-Correlation Learning Architecture\" [2]. There, I used it to train the neural network's output and hidden neurons, which was a mistake I realized only later and which we'll also look into here._\n",
    "\n",
    "_To follow along with this article, you should be familiar with how neural networks can be trained using back-propagation of the loss gradient (as of 2020, a widely used approach). That is, you should understand how the gradient is usually calculated and applied to the parameters of a network to try to iteratively achieve convergence of the loss to a global minimum._\n",

    "## The Mathematics Behind Quickprop\n",
    "\n",
    "The often used learning method of back-propagation for neural networks is based on the idea of iteratively 'riding down' the slop of a function, by taking short steps in the inverse direction of its gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "These 'short steps' are the crux here. Their length usually depends on a learning rate factor, and that is kept intentionally small to not overshoot a potential minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in the days when Fahlman developed Quickprop, choosing a good learning rate was something of a major problem. As he actually mentions in his paper, in the best performing algorithm, the scientist chose the learning rate 'by eye' (i.e. manually and based on experience) every step along the way! [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Faced with this, Fahlman came up with a different idea: Solving a simpler problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimizing the loss function ***L***, especially for deep neural networks, can become extremely difficult analytically (i.e. in a general way on the entire domain).  \n",
    "In back-propagation, for instance, we only calculate it point-wise and then do the small steps in the right direction. If we would know how the 'terrain' of the function looks like in general, we could 'jump' to the minimum directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if we could replace the loss function with a simpler version, of which we know its terrain?\n",
    "This is exactly Fahlmans' assumption taken in Quickprop: He presumes that ***L*** can be approximated by a simple parabola that opens in the positive direction. This way, calculating the minimum (of the parabola) is as simple as finding the intersection of a line with the x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "And if that point is not yet a minimum of the loss function, the next parabola can be approximated from there, like in the graphic below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Animation of Quickprop](./img/quickprop.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A parabola is fit to the original function and a step is taken towards its minimum. From there, the next parabola is fit and the next step is taken. The two dotted lines are the current and a previous stationary point of the parabola. (Graphic by author)\n",
    "\n",
    "So... How exactly can we approximate ***L***? Easy - using a [Taylor series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series), and a small trick.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note that for the following equations, we consider the components of the weight vector ***w*** to be trained independently, so ***w*** is meant to be seen as a scalar. But we can still exploit the SIMD architecture of GPU's, using component-wise computations._\n",
    "\n",

    "\\end{align} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "## Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "Quickprop has one major caveat that greatly reduces its usefulness: The mathematical 'trick' we used, i.e. the approximation of the second order derivative of the loss function with a simple difference quotient relies on the assumption that this second order derivative is a continuous function.  \n",
    "This is not given for activation functions like e.g. the rectified linear unit, or ReLU for short. The second-order derivative is discontinuous and the behaviour of the algorithm might become unreliable (e.g. it might diverge).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking back at [my earlier article](https://towardsdatascience.com/cascade-correlation-a-forgotten-learning-architecture-a2354a0bec92) covering the implementation of Cascade-Correlation, we trained the hidden units of the network using Quickprop and used the covariance function as a way to estimate loss in that process.\n",
    "However, the covariance (as implemented there) is wrapped in an absolute value function.\n",
    "I.e. its second-order derivative is discontinuous and therefore, Quickprop should not be used.\n",
    "The careful reader of Fahlman et al.'s Cascade-Correlation paper [2] may have also noticed that they are actually using gradient ascent to calculate this maximum covariance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from that, it also seems that Quickprop delivers better results on some domains rather than others. An interesting summary by Brust et al. showed that it achieved better training results compared to the quality of back-propagation based techniques on some simple image classification tasks (classifying basic shapes) while at the same time doing worse on more realistic image classification tasks [3].  \n",
    "I haven't done any research in that direction, but I wonder if this could imply that Quickprop might work better on less fuzzy and more structured data (think data frames/tables used in a business context). That would surely be interesting to investigate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This article covered Scott Fahlman's idea of improving back-propagation. We had a look at the mathematical foundations and a possible implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now go about and try it out for your own projects - I'd love to see what Quickprop can used for!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to see variants of Quickprop in action, check out [my series of articles](https://towardsdatascience.com/cascade-correlation-a-forgotten-learning-architecture-a2354a0bec92) on the Cascade-Correlation Learning Architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "All finished notebooks and code of this series are also [available on Github](https://github.com/ephe-meral/cascor). Please feel encouraged to leave feedback and suggest improvements."
